## Steps to start a project
  - Use command `python -m pip install -U pip` and `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install libraries.
  - Go to the folder where `manage.py` is located and use command `python manage.py runserver` to run server.
  - Open Postman (or other querying program) and send a POST request to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/products`. You must also attach the xlsx file with the articles to the request.
